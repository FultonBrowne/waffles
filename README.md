# waffles
A simple project using the waffle framework, just to get familiar with it

It does a build with:
```
npm run build
```
and does tests with:
```
npm run tests
```

boom, smart contracts. Easy to use and powerful - I love it. Credit to the waffle dev's - someone give them a raise

to generate the bytecode use:
```
npm run release
```

To deploy it just upload the sol file to remix - it's shitty, but works
